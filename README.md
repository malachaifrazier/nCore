nCore -- an artificial neural network research library
======================================================

This library is currently under continuous development.  The goal is to create artificial neural network algorithms that generalize extremely well and learn relatively quickly -- by using a combination of flocking (i.e., a form of clustering) and backpropagation of both (1) output error and (2) flocking error.  It is hoped that such algorithms will be particularly useful for training deep neural networks (i.e., multiple hidden layers).

The study of the most fundamental processes involved in the formation of analogies is also a particularly optimistic goal for this project.  

Flocking forms the core of the self-organization methods used in these algorithms.  Initial work in this area was conducted by Matt Potter and Mark White.  More information can be obtained from [Matt Potter's MS Thesis](http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/148/2/etd.pdf)

I would be very interested in discussing or collaborating with anyone interested in these aspects of neural network learning, and machine learning in general.  My email address is mark@markwhite.name
